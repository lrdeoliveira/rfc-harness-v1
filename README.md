## Kanban board

The run visualization is the web board. `ralph` opens `http://127.0.0.1:3847` on this machine only (override the port with `RALPH_BOARD_PORT`). `ralph board` reopens the board for a run already on disk.

![Ralph Kanban board, with phases in Backlog, In Progress, and Done](assets/ralph-board.png)

The header shows the mark, how many phases are done, and the run bar. The line under it names the project, engine, status, and run id. Each phase is a chip; the one in execution has a red border.

The three columns are **Backlog**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. A phase card shows duration, cycle, a slice of the phase text, cited files, the four gates (G0–G3), and the tasks. A failed phase stays in In Progress. The page reads `/state.json` every second: `run.tsv` is the orchestrator state and `live.tsv` is the task the session is on right now.

The terminal panel (`ralph-watch.sh`, `--dashboard`) is the same state drawn in the shell. The board is the interface for watching the run.

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin with commands, agents, and scripts that take a project from idea to implementation in a structured way: formal specification, phased planning, and autonomous execution with mechanical validation — while keeping a human in control at every decision point.

The harness is **stack-agnostic**: language, framework, commands, and conventions are defined by the project's own documents (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, the `.spec/` chain), never by the harness.

                                            code; feeds /plan and ralph)
```

Three independent pipelines that fit together:

1. **`/init`** — from zero to a project build plan (description → user stories → schema → phases).
2. **`/plan`** — from a feature description to a formal SPEC + phased plan, ready for execution.
3. **`ralph.sh`** — executes any phase document autonomously, one fresh agent session per phase, with mechanical gates and one commit per completed phase.

Cross-cutting: **`/ai-context`** keeps the context tree (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/agents/*.md`) in sync with the real code.

## Installation

This repository is a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). Install it via marketplace/local path according to your plugin setup:

```
/plugin marketplace add /Volumes/M5SSD/Projetos/rfc-harness-v1
/plugin install rfc-harness
```

Commands are namespaced: `/rfc-harness:init`, `/rfc-harness:plan`, `/rfc-harness:ai-context` (abbreviated without the namespace throughout this document).

To refresh Cursor / OpenCode / Codex / SGM copies:

```
./scripts/sync-hosts.sh
```

`ralph.sh` is a standalone bash script — copy or reference `scripts/ralph.sh` and run it directly in the target project's repository.

**ralph.sh prerequisites:**

- Codex engine: `npm install -g @openai/codex` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Claude engine: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Cursor engine: Cursor Agent CLI (`agent` or `cursor-agent`) + `agent login`
- Bash 4+ (macOS `/bin/bash` is 3.2 — `brew install bash`; ralph re-execs it automatically)
- Root of a git repository with a **clean** working tree

## Commands

### `/init` — init chain router

Shows the state of the `.spec/init/` artifacts (present / absent / stale), the **OBSERVED** stack (manifests only — `.env` is never read), and **invokes the next command in the chain** (one hop per run — re-run `/init` to advance). Writes nothing itself; all authoring lives in the invoked `init:*` command.

The same snapshot is available from another terminal without starting `/init`:

```bash
./scripts/init-status.sh              # colored panel
./scripts/init-status.sh --plain      # markdown (what /init consumes)
```

The chain, in order:

| # | Artifact | Command | Inputs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `.spec/init/project-description.md` | `/init:project-description` | — (head of chain) |
| 2 | `.spec/init/user-stories.md` | `/init:user-stories` | project-description |
| 3 | `.spec/init/database-schema.md` | `/init:database-schema` | description + stories |
| 4 | `.spec/init/project-phases.md` | `/init:project-phases` | description + stories + schema |
| — | `.spec/init/design/` | manual (optional) | — |

Every generated artifact carries a **stamp** of its inputs on line 3 (`file@sha256:<12 chars>`). If an input changes later, `/init` detects it and reports the downstream artifact as *stale* — re-running the corresponding command is upsert-safe: it interviews only about the deltas and refreshes the stamp.

- **`/init:project-description`** — interviews the developer, discovers the stack (OBSERVED / INFERRED / UNKNOWN), and produces a structured project description.
- **`/init:user-stories`** — derives structured, testable user stories from the description.
- **`/init:database-schema`** — derives a suggested database schema in DBML.
- **`/init:project-phases`** — plans the build into numbered, agent-ready phases with tasks, acceptance criteria, and feature tests. **This is `ralph.sh`'s default input.** Reads `.spec/init/design/` when present (screen/component refs).

### `/plan` — feature planning pipeline

```
/plan "<feature description or path to a description file>"
```

Produces, under `.spec/features/<slug>/`:

| Artifact | Content |
|---|---|
| `SPEC.md` | Formal specification in GEARS syntax, with RIGID/FLEXIBLE sections, AS IS / TO BE diagrams, and binary acceptance criteria |
| `PLAN.md` | Architecture-aware task decomposition with dependency phases, risks, and validation criteria |
| `PHASES.md` | The PLAN rendered in the format executable by `ralph.sh` |
| `openapi.yaml` / `service.proto` / `asyncapi.yaml` | Formal contracts, when the SPEC declares an API surface (conditional) |

Key characteristics:

- **No issue tracker** — the confirmed description + ACs are the source of truth. No Jira.
- **Complexity tier** (`light` / `standard` / `complete`) classified from objective signals (requirement count, multi-repo, contracts, messaging); adjusts SPEC depth, whether the clarifier is mandatory, and contract emission.
- **Human checkpoints** at every step: confirmation of the normalized input, SPEC approval, ambiguity resolution, decomposition sign-off.
- **Two-phase clarifier** — the agent analyzes the SPEC and returns prioritized questions; the router presents them to the developer and re-invokes the agent with the answers, which updates the SPEC in-place.
- **Architecture gate** — requires `AGENTS.md` / `docs/agents/` (or warns and flags `architecture_reference_status: missing`). The pipeline never plans silently without architecture context.
- **Never writes application code.** The close-out points at the execution handoff:

```bash
./ralph.sh .spec/features/<slug>/PHASES.md
```

### `/ai-context` — canonical context tree

```
/ai-context [path] [+id] [-id] [--adopt]
```

Generates or refreshes 10 artifacts from the **implemented code** (never reads `.spec/`):

| Artifact | Content |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | 6 sections: commands, conventions, behavioral rules, setup, references, docs index |
| `CLAUDE.md` | ≤ 400-byte redirect to AGENTS.md |
| `docs/agents/project_overview.md` | Purpose, consumers, macro flow |
| `docs/agents/architecture.md` | Style, layout, layer responsibilities |
| `docs/agents/tech_stack.md` | Language, framework, runtime, test tooling |
| `docs/agents/coding_guidelines.md` | ≥ 3 observed patterns + enforcement |
| `docs/agents/domain_rules.md` | Business rules as implemented |
| `docs/agents/api_contracts.md` | Endpoints, payloads, message formats |
| `docs/agents/data_model.md` | Entities, storage, migrations |
| `docs/agents/dependencies.md` | External services, internal libs, shared infra |

Core rules:

- **Idempotent** — safe upsert; re-running updates only what drifted.
- **Documents reality (AS IS)** — code, manifests, CI, and configs are the only sources; never invents, never prescribes.
- **Ownership contract** — every generated file carries a banner on line 3. A file without the banner (hand-written) is never clobbered; `--adopt` folds its concrete rules into the generated tree and takes ownership.
- **Preserves third-party blocks** — `<tag>...</tag>` regions (e.g. Laravel Boost) are re-appended verbatim on regeneration.
- `+id` / `-id` filters generate only a subset (e.g. `/ai-context +AGENTS +architecture`).

## `scripts/ralph.sh` — execution orchestrator

Reads a phase document, splits it on the `## Phase N: <title>` heading, and feeds each phase to a **fresh** Codex CLI, Claude Code, or Cursor Agent session, with no human interaction from start to finish.

```bash
./scripts/ralph.sh [options] [path-to-file]
```

With no argument, the input resolves in this order: `.spec/init/project-phases.md` → `.spec/project-phases.md` (pre-init layout, with a warning). A feature `PHASES.md` is also valid input.

> **Autonomy and permissions note**: ralph is an unattended orchestrator by design. Implementation sessions skip permission prompts — Claude with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, Cursor with `--force` (`--yolo`) and sandbox disabled. The agent can edit files and run commands in the repository without prompting. Run it only in repositories you trust, ideally in a disposable branch or isolated environment (container/VM). Every phase lands as a separate commit, so `git revert`/`git reset` always gets you back. The verification session (gate 3) is read-only: Claude is restricted to `Read,Glob,Grep`; Cursor runs with `--mode ask` and sandbox enabled (no `--force`).

### Invariants

1. Every phase **and** every fix cycle runs in a fresh session with a self-contained prompt. Sessions are never reused.
2. Zero questions — fully autonomous execution.
3. A phase is only "complete" when it passes the **4 mechanical gates**, never by the engine's exit code.
4. API usage limit → waits for the reset and re-runs the **same** phase, without consuming a fix cycle.
5. **One commit per completed phase** (`feat(phase-N): <title>`).

### The 4 gates

| Gate | Question | How it decides |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Did the engine actually finish? | claude: `is_error` in the result JSON; cursor: `is_error` when the stream emits `type:result`, otherwise exit code; codex: exit code |
| 1 | Did the session write code? | Tree signature before/after. **A signal, not a verdict** — an already-implemented phase makes the engine (correctly) write nothing; the signal feeds the fix-cycle cause |
| 2 | Does the test suite pass? | Run **by ralph itself**, outside the agent session — the agent cannot "fake green" |
| 3 | Is each task actually in the code? | Independent read-only verifier session that emits `TASK <n>: DONE/INCOMPLETE` per task. Runs on every phase by default (`RALPH_VERIFY=always`); on the claude engine it uses a cheap model (`sonnet`) |

Any red gate → **fix cycle**: a fresh session receives the full phase + the real failure cause (never a generic "tests failed"). Default: 3 cycles per phase.

Green gates with a clean tree → the phase was already implemented at HEAD: marked done, no commit.

### Test command detection (gate 2)

First rule that resolves wins: `--test-cmd` → `RALPH_TEST_CMD` → manifest detection (Laravel Sail → `composer test` → `php artisan test` → `npm test` → `pytest` → `go test ./...` → `cargo test`) → nothing resolved = gate 2 skipped with a loud warning (gate 3 holds the line alone).

Laravel Sail projects: the suite runs **inside the container** (`vendor/bin/sail test`); stopped containers abort at preflight — every gate 2 would fail and burn fix cycles for nothing.

### Options and variables

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--engine codex\|claude\|cursor` | Implementation engine (default: `codex`) |
| `--from N` | Starts at phase N (clears progress for phases ≥ N) |
| `--keep-going` | Continues after a phase fails (creates a `wip(phase-N)` commit; default: stop) |
| `--max-cycles N` | Fix cycles per phase (default: 3) |
| `--test-cmd "<cmd>"` | Project test command (gate 2) |
| `--no-verify` | Disables gate 3 |
| `--dashboard` | Live panel in the terminal (see below) |
| `--board` | Opens the Kanban board at `http://127.0.0.1:3847` |

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RALPH_TEST_CMD` | Test command (gate 2) |
| `RALPH_VERIFY` | Gate 3: `always` (default) \| `auto` (saves tokens: only when gate 2's verdict isn't enough) \| `off` |
| `RALPH_VERIFY_MODEL` | Verifier model (claude default: `sonnet`) |
| `RALPH_MAX_CYCLES` | Fix cycles per phase (default: 3) |
| `RALPH_MAX_LIMIT_WAITS` | Consecutive usage-limit waits, per phase (default: 20) |
| `RALPH_LIMIT_WAIT_DEFAULT` | Fallback wait in seconds (default: 1800) |
| `RALPH_LIMIT_BUFFER` | Extra seconds after the reset (default: 60) |
| `RALPH_BASH` | Bash 4+ interpreter (macOS: ralph re-execs Homebrew bash when `/bin/bash` is 3.2) |

During each session, ralph exports `RALPH_ENGINE`, `RALPH_PHASE_TITLE`, `RALPH_PHASE_NUM`, `RALPH_PHASE_TOTAL`, `RALPH_PHASE_ATTEMPT`, and `RALPH_PHASE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` — useful for notification hooks (e.g. n8n).

### State and progress

Internal work lives in `.phases/` (registered in `.git/info/exclude`, without touching the project's `.gitignore`): split phases, prompts, logs, manifest, and `.progress`. Progress survives across runs, but only for the **same input** (sha256 stamp) — a changed phase document resets progress.

When `detect-project.sh` sits next to `ralph.sh`, preflight publishes the OBSERVED stack, env, and branch into `.phases/state/run.tsv` (the live panel shows them). Each cycle also writes a mechanical evidence contract at `.phases/logs/phase-NN.cycle-K.evidence.md` (`RESULT`, `GATES`, `TESTS` with COMMAND / EXIT / STATUS). That file is the truth source for the run — the agent is also asked to write a sibling `.agent-evidence.md`, but the orchestrator never trusts it over the gates.

Exit code: `0` = all phases green; `1` = some phase failed or aborted.

## `scripts/ralph-watch.sh` — terminal panel

The Kanban board is the run visualization. This script is the same reading, drawn in the terminal. ralph publishes run state to `.phases/state/` **always**, with or without `--dashboard`. `ralph-watch.sh` reads that state and draws the panel:

```bash
./scripts/ralph.sh --engine claude --dashboard   # panel in the same terminal
./scripts/ralph.sh --engine cursor --dashboard   # same panel, Cursor Agent CLI
./scripts/ralph-watch.sh /path/to/repo           # panel from another terminal
```

```

```

### Where per-task progress comes from

A phase is **one** agent session, so ralph could not know where the session is — unless the session says so. On the **claude** and **cursor** engines it does:

The session runs with `--output-format stream-json`, which emits events line by line **while** it works. ralph reads that stream and rewrites progress into `.phases/state/live.tsv`, from four sources, in this order of precedence:

1. **Text markers** (primary source). The prompt tells the agent to write, as a standalone line, `RALPH-TASK <n> START` before starting item *n* and `RALPH-TASK <n> DONE` once it is ready. It is plain text: it **depends on no tool at all** — which is what matters, because in a headless session (`claude -p`) task-list tools simply do not exist, even when the agent tries to load them via `ToolSearch`.
2. **The agent's task list**, when the session has one (`TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` or `TodoWrite`): its `in_progress`/`completed` transitions become progress.
3. **Observational fallback** — with no marker and no list, ralph infers from what the agent edits. A `/plan` plan declares `Arquivos:` on every item, and it is that match (edited path ↔ file declared by the task) that provides the granularity; without the declaration it falls back to the task's own text. On entering a task the earlier ones count as done — the agent works in order, and not every task has a file of its own.
4. **Sign of life**: as soon as the session opens, task 1 shows as running — never a whole phase frozen at "Pendente".

At the end of the phase, **gate 3 has the last word**: the verifier's `TASK <n>: DONE/INCOMPLETE` verdict overrides marker, list and inference alike. A task marked done but not in the code shows up as `! Incompleta`.

So: during the phase the panel shows the agent's intent; at the end of the phase it shows the verified truth.

On the **codex** engine there is no equivalent stream — granularity stays per phase, and tasks show as pending until gate 3's verdict.

### Large plans: pinned top, scrolling table

With dozens of tasks the table no longer fits on screen. The panel then keeps **the top pinned** (identification, bars, current work) and scrolls the phase/task table inside a window sized to the terminal — with a scrollbar on the right edge and a footer stating what fell outside:

```
  ▲ 23 above · ▼ 9 below · following the current phase · ↑↓ PgUp/PgDn scroll · f follows the phase
```

The running line — phase and task — is **highlighted end to end**, so it can be spotted at a glance in a full table.

By default the window **follows the current phase**: it shows the whole phase block when it fits, and centers the running task when it doesn't. The keys below take over at any time and also work under `--dashboard`, with the panel embedded in ralph:

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` or `k` `j` | Scrolls one line |
| `PgUp` `PgDn`, `b` or space | Scrolls one page |
| `Home`/`g` and `End`/`G` | First and last line |
| `f` | Goes back to following the current phase |
| `q` | Quits the panel (standalone mode only; does not stop ralph) |

| Watch option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--once` | Draws one frame and exits (useful in scripts/CI); full dump, no clipping |
| `--interval N` | Seconds between frames (default: 1) |
| `--no-color` | Disables ANSI |
| `--color` | Forces ANSI even without a terminal (tests, files) |
| `RALPH_WATCH_COLS` | Pins the width, for terminals that don't report it |
| `RALPH_WATCH_LINES` | Pins the height; with `--once` it also enables the scrolling window |

With `--dashboard`, ralph's log lines go to `.phases/logs/ralph.log` (the panel owns the screen) and the final report prints to the terminal on exit. Without `ralph-watch.sh` next to `ralph.sh`, `--dashboard` warns and falls back to log mode — `ralph.sh` stays copyable on its own into another repository.


### Input format contract

Validated at preflight:

- ≥ 1 heading `## Phase N: <title>`
- No `## Phase ...` heading outside that format (a malformed heading silently disappears from the run — preflight aborts before burning tokens)
- Sub-phases as `### Phase N.M:` (do not become their own session)
- Any other `## ` heading ends the previous phase's capture

## Agents

Commands are **thin routers** — all template knowledge lives in the agents:

| Agent | Pipeline | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `specifier` | `/plan` §5 | Confirmed description + ACs → formal SPEC.md (GEARS, RIGID/FLEXIBLE) |
| `clarifier` | `/plan` §6 | Adversarial requirements QA: finds ambiguities, resolves them with the developer's answers |
| `planner` | `/plan` §7 | SPEC → PLAN.md + PHASES.md + contracts; read-only over the code |
| `ai-context-inspector` | `/ai-context` §3 | Read-only repo sweep → structured digest |
| `ai-context-core` | `/ai-context` §4 | Digest → `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` |
| `ai-context-docs` | `/ai-context` §4 | Digest → the 8 `docs/agents/*.md` files |

The two `/ai-context` writers run in parallel (disjoint files, read-only digest).

## Development

```bash
scripts/test-ralph.sh        # ralph.sh suite — fake `claude`/`codex`/`agent` binaries
                             # on PATH, zero network, zero tokens; exit 0 = green
scripts/test-ralph.sh <case> # run a single case
scripts/check-shell.sh       # bash -n over all scripts + shellcheck when available
scripts/check-init-drift.sh  # verbatim anchors for the shared init:* rules
```

About `check-init-drift.sh`: the four `commands/init/*.md` files **intentionally inline** the same interview, language, re-run, staleness, and developer-facing-reply rules — plugin commands must be self-contained at runtime (they execute inside the developer's project, where the plugin root is not reachable via `@`-includes). The three routers share the same reply contract. The cost of that duplication is silent drift; the script makes drift loud.

## Design principles

- **Thin routers, agents own the content** — commands orchestrate, verify artifacts on disk, and report; they never author SPEC/PLAN/docs.
- **Trust, but verify** — every artifact delivered by an agent is mechanically validated (existence, headings, counts) by the router.
- **Reality ≠ intent** — `/ai-context` documents only what is implemented; `.spec/` is invisible to it. The `.spec/` chain documents intent.
- **No git writes from commands** — the developer reviews with `git diff` and commits manually. The only thing that commits is `ralph.sh`, by design (one commit per validated phase).
- **No secrets** — `.env` is never read; env var names come from `.env.example` only.
- **Explicit, never blocking staleness** — sha256 stamps detect outdated inputs; the decision always belongs to the developer.
- **Developer-facing replies are actionable** — `/init`, `/plan`, `/ai-context`, and the `/init:*` interviews lead with the next command, restate the pipeline step (`init 2/4 — user-stories`), and end with one action doable in under two minutes. This does **not** apply to `ralph.sh` implementation sessions or to generated artifacts (SPEC / PLAN / PHASES stay complete).
