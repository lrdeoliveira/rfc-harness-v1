# check-init-drift.sh — guard against textual drift of the shared rules
# duplicated across the init command suite.
#
# The four commands/init/*.md files intentionally inline the same interview,
# language, re-run, staleness, close-out, and developer-facing-reply rules
# instead of referencing a shared file: plugin commands must be self-contained
# at runtime (they execute inside the developer's project, where the plugin
# root is not reachable via @-includes). The three routers (init.md, plan.md,
# ai-context.md) share the same developer-facing reply contract. The cost of
# that duplication is silent drift — this script makes drift loud. Each
# anchor below is a sentence (or fragment) that must appear verbatim in every
# file of its group; rewording one copy breaks the anchor and fails the check.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-init-drift.sh   (from anywhere; exits 0 = no drift)
